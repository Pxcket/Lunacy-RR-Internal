# üß† Lunacy - Rec Room Internal Mod

*A comprehensive internal modification framework for educational and research purposes*

---

## üìñ Overview

**Lunacy** is an advanced internal modification system designed for Rec Room, providing extensive customization capabilities through a sophisticated hooking architecture and intuitive graphical interface. Originally developed as a premium modification tool, this project demonstrates advanced reverse engineering techniques and game modification methodologies.

## NOTE:
This is a shit Hook Only cheat ive spend maybe couple hours to made, if you skid it just be sure to credit me :p 
im NOT going to help you dump the game, dont even ask.
